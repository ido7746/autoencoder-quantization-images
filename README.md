## How to run

 In this submission we have two notebooks (one using GAN, one that does not use GAN).
 to run both of the notebooks there are two options:
1. run without loading the model’s weights
to do that, run each cell one after the other.
2. load our model’s weights
	to do that, uncomment the following code in the notebook and add the path to the model’s weights (the pt file which is included in the submission).
